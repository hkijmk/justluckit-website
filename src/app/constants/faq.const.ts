             affects the draw result. After the draw, all coupons in the program are checked one by one by the program. Solana (Total Amount) collected in the pool is distributed to the winners by the

        question: `How is the World Lottery lottery done?`,
        answers: [
            `The World Lottery draw is made by people who play coupons that week. In Solana Blockchain, information is recorded in accounts. This information can be changed and read by smart 
            contracts. Before the smart contract is called, accounts are marked as read-only or read-and-modifiable. Exchangeable accounts can only be used by one person at a time. As mentioned 
            earlier, the draw is done by wallets playing coupons that week. The draw is held on Saturday at +GMT 00:00:00 every week according to UNIX time. Each player who makes a coupon affects the
            results of that week's and subsequent games. Factors including the number of coupons, the numbers chosen, and how many people entered determine the draw result. When it is time for the 
            draw, the 10 players who press the draw button and call the smart contract first make the draw in order. Each player who makes the draw once again affects the results of the draw. The 
            first 10 players to make the draw win 1% of the previous draw, as they are the first 10 to call the smart contract. After this process, the results of all players who have made coupons 
            that week are determined.`,

             you are one of the lucky winners of the sweepstakes, you will be automatically sent your winnings within a few hours to a few days, depending on the interest in the sweepstakes.`,
